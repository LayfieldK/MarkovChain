# MarkovChain
A windows forms application that allows a user to input up to two pieces of text and receive a predictive piece of output text based on the two inputs.

The program uses Markov Chains to learn word sequences from both inputs and then combines them into one common dictionary.  It then chooses a random starting word and continues to use its learned dictionary to form sentences.  The output is generally non-sense, but often funny.

Here is some example output that I gathered when combining "The Hobbit" by JRR Tolkien with "At the Mountains of Madness" by HP Lovecraft:

`This is the dragons ' way , we were glad to cheat when they saw that all was up , hope for the most part , the art of creating new life from inorganic substances ; they were more dangerous than they had been feeling rather pleased with their own hands more than they could shout in praise of the completely successful transportation of the others sat near the outer walls seemed to swell up as big as themselves , and the torches , for there were other tales , tales of long ago , when they were piled with shingles . The fifth aëroplane , which we did not remember things very well , and then on another snag and falling with a splash of white on the mat , I suppose you will see , if ever we arrive there . His torch dropped head downwards and went off poof ! into a chuckling laugh : they had put there the wild tales of new prothalli except when , in spite of his chief servants . So they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations . " Balin at your service ! " squeaked Bilbo . They were not likely to visit our relatives , and that there was the upsetting of the dwarves of Dain and more to the power of the hall below : the goblin feet , the lust , the wars of the King of All Birds and wore a golden ring , and the other two . " Well , it was not yet realized . They were alone in the beckoning sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the water on every side , gave a loud knock . Not that Belladonna Took , head of the valleys below . Silently , clinging onto Dori 's legs , and many little round doors opened out of the smooth-floored lateral tunnels . We could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole white world would be cumbrous to give Gedney up for lost , gollum . " " There is yet time for him to perform the heavy pack and the getting rid of me , " said one . Tell me what you want to get fourteen huge specimens to camp . Bombur slept on with . Not even our clever eyeses will notice already that Mr. Baggins . Just coming round again , when they had crossed over . Then they set about raising many huts by the breeze in his hands snapped on thin air , and some little better than I used to go as best he could bear it any longer ? Old Smaug has lived there long enough , they were in springtime no less marvellous than in high place . But nothing they could see in the corner of the land dwellers had to rescue him . On some of which they could now see a dwarvish foot sticking out of him for , and there was a great bear prowling along in , more removed from the side every now and then at evening began their long imprisonment . Bilbo sat gloomily in the days when such a direction -- in which we had come to be sure , " he said to it . I followed him , under the new base . It was after tea-time ; it was good to eat , and why it did not attack them if there is a fair size , and great crashes split the air afar . A few daring mystics have hinted at a great black pot , and had been . Whether it was now lifeless , and cutting at the high table , and all could get nothing more till the dawn chilled his wrath and he had guessed . The dwarves wanted to know why he had very sharp eyes , wriggling in the tangled ground level . The other ponies came in his ears , and not fourteen , unless I am a wizard , who were not all pony-rides in May - sunshine , when Dale in the old bark of the dark mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the Hill at home and have some more ! And if you tried to brace up for fourteen ! " he gloated . " I feel sick and weary , and a goblin had pushed it nearly to , if you had better take this way he could sleep contentedly , though I will make you an offer . I expect smokes and steams would come . One aëroplane shelter -- all very much stuck up in a leather sheath . " To the end . The barrels now all lashed together creaked and slammed . Beorn said something to do but to keep off the spider jumped back , holding him right way up , by accident . Still there it was only a legend . The stars were out in a wide view East and West and make some plans . " " Thank you ! " they asked no more notice of him  What about cartage ? What were you doing in the interest of economy and probable efficiency . Wireless reports have spoken of . " It must n't ask us !
